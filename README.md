Select the Subscription and Resource group you want to place the storage account into. 

NOTE: storage account names must be globally unique within Azure. No two storage accounts within all of Azure can have the same name.

Also select the Region you want the storage account located in. This refers to the location of the physical data center the service instance will reside. It’s considered good practice to keep services in the same location as the resource group they reside in.

Select “Review” at the bottom.

The storage account has now been generated.

A storage account is essentially a hyper-charged, high-capacity Google Drive or Dropbox type of service with many additional features beyond those of a traditional, consumer grade cloud storage services. 

E.g. storage accounts can be used to host websites and their accompanying dependencies.
